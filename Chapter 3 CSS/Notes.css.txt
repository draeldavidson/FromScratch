*CSS
    CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. CSS is a style sheet language
    used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup
    language such as HTML. Three ways of inserting css is 

    1. External, you can change the look of an entire website by changing just one file!
    2. Internal may be used if one single HTML page has a unique style by using the 
    <style> element, inside the head section.
    3. Inline may be used to apply a unique style for a single element they are defined
    within the "style" attribute of the relevant element

    CSS selectors  select the HTML element(s) you want to style. The element selector 
    selects HTML elements based on the element name. For example p{....} will apply to 
    all <p> elements. The box model is a box that wraps around every html element. 
    The box consists of four small boxes: margins, borders, padding, and the actual content. 
    think of CSS specificity as a score/rank that determines which style declarations are 
    ultimately applied to an element. If there are two or more CSS rules that point to the 
    same element, the selector with the highest specificity value will "win", and its style 
    declaration will be applied to that HTML element. Responsive web design (RWD) is a 
    web development approach that creates dynamic changes to the appearance of a website, 
    depending on the screen size and orientation of the device being used to view it. like 
    a button enlarging when the cursor hovers over it. 

    CSS Grid is a two-dimensional grid system used to work on the layout of UI 
    elements and segments of a webpage also allows for more standardized code that works 
    across browsers. align components into rows and columns. With Flexbox, you can lay out 
    and align elements in a container even if you don't know the size of those elements or 
    if the size might change. That's because a flex container is flexible: it expands the 
    flex elements to fill space when it's available and shrinks them to prevent overflow when 
    it's not. Bootstrap offers a twelve-column system with dozens of predefined classes. 
    That means you can use its mobile-first flexbox grid to build unique and complex layouts 
    without having to build them from scratch

*The Basics*
    - p { font-size: 120%; color: dimgray; } ←paragraph slightly
     larger than usual. And with dark grey text, instead of black.
   
    - p.smallcaps { font-variant: small-caps; } ←destination 
    paragraphs that should be in small caps
    
    - <p class="smallcaps">Your paragraph here.</p> ←a paragraph 
    that's entirely in small caps
    
    - text-transform: uppercase; text-transform: lowercase; text-transform:
     capitalize; ← change a set of text to a specific case
    
    - a:link { color: gray; } a:visited { color: green; } 
    a:hover { color: purple; } a:active { color: teal; } ←There are four different 
    colors a link can be assigned: its standard color, its visited color, 
    its hover color, and its active color (which it displays while you're clicking on it).
   
    - a { text-decoration: none; } ←remove underlines on links
    
    - a:hover { text-decoration: underline; } ←Want to underline it when the user hovers over it
    
    - a:link, a:visited, a:hover, a:active 
    { background-color: green; color: white; padding: 10px 25px; text-align: center; 
    text-decoration: none; display: inline-block; } ←A link button
    
    - p.important { border-style: solid; border-width: 5px; border-color: purple; } ←add a border
    
    - <p class="important">Your important paragraph here.</p> ←a solid purple border, five pixels wide, 
    around any important-class paragraph.
   
    - border-width: 5px 8px 3px 9px; ←border styles you can apply; instead of "solid," try "dotted" or 
    "double." Meanwhile, the width can be "thin," "medium," or "thick." CSS code can even define the 
    thickness of each border individually, like this
   
    - .center { display: block; margin: auto; } ←Center align
   
    - img { margin: auto; } ← center all images
   
    - .centertext { text-align: center; } ← center text
   
    - <p class="centertext">This text will be centered.</p> center text in a paragraph
   
    - img { padding-top: 40px; padding-right: 25px; padding-bottom: 40px; padding-left: 25px; } ←every 
    image to have 20 pixels of padding on the left and right sides, and 40 pixels on the top and bottom.
  
    - img { padding: 40px 25px 40px 25px; } ← same but shorter
   
    - img { padding: 40px 25px } ← This sets the top, right, bottom, and left paddings to the right number. 
    Thanks to only two values being used (40 and 25) you can make it even shorter:
  
    - tr:hover { background-color: #ddd; } highlight table rows
  
    - img { opacity: 0.5; filter: alpha(opacity=50); } ←display images at less than full opacity, 
    so they appear slightly "whited out". When you mouse over the images, they're brought to full opacity
  
    - img:hover { opacity: 1.0; filter: alpha(opacity=100); } ←The "filter" attribute does the same 
    thing as "opacity," but Internet Explorer 8 and earlier don't recognize the opacity measurement. 
    For older browsers, it's a good idea to include it.
