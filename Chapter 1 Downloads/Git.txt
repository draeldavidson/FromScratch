*Git is a version control system... 
    designed to handle everything from small to very large projects 
    with speed and efficiency.  One person can create a remote 
    repository and share it with a group of developers. 
    Then each developer can copy from the remote 
    repository to their local machine. They can then make changes and 
    share with other developers by saving to the remote repository. 
    Git helps coordinate work among programmers who were operating source codes 
    during software development.

        To download git
            - had to download homebrew By opening up my terminal on my computer 
            and insert in the code. Then to download git 
            I had to enter brew install git. 
            (https://git-scm.com/downloads)

            check to see if git is installed:
                git --version
