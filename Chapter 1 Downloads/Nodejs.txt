    to download
        (https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
        check to see if node is installed:
            - Check with `node -v`
            - Check with `npm -v`


    Node. js is primarily used for non-blocking, event-driven servers, due to its 
    single-threaded nature. It's used for traditional web sites and back-end API services, 
    but was designed with real-time, push-based architectures in mind. 
    The node_modules folder contains every installed dependency for your project.



    *node commands...
        npm i -g nodemon <--Install the nodemon module globally to system path
        npm i --save-dev nodemon <--You can also install nodemon as a development-dependency
        nodemon app.js  <--Run the application using nodemon followed by application file name.

        node --version
        Ctrl + C -To terminate the command
        Ctrl + C {twice} / Ctrl + D -To exit the command prompt

        npm or the Node Package Manager, is one of the most used tools for any 
        Node.js developer.
        # install
        npm i <package>

        # uninstall
        npm un <package>

        # update
        npm up <package>

        npm -g uninstall <name> -Uninstall global package
        npm outdated -g --depth=0 -To see which packages need updating
        npm update -g <package> <package> <package> -To update global packages

    *Package.json
    A package. json is a JSON file that exists at the root of a Javascript/Node project. 
    It holds metadata relevant to the project and it is used for managing the project's 
    dependencies, scripts, version and a whole lot more.

        How to install
            1.On the command line, navigate to the root directory of your package.
            2.npm init --y <--creates the .json in the folder


    package-lock.json is automatically generated for any operations where npm 
        modifies either the node_modules tree, or package.json. It describes the 
        exact tree that was generated, such that subsequent installs are able to 
        generate identical trees, regardless of intermediate dependency updates.


    The node_modules folder is used to save all downloaded packages from NPM in 
    your computer for the JavaScript project that you have. Developers are 
    always recommended to do a fresh install with npm install each time they 
    downloaded a JavaScript project into their computer.
